  although HTML5 allows multiple <h1> tags when used within sections or articles.
-->

<!-- Type Question 4 Answer Below -->
"No"
<!-- 
  It is not logical to have an <h2> tag within the same context if the product's title is an <h3>. 
  Headings should follow a logical hierarchy (e.g., <h3> should be followed by <h4> or lower).
-->

<!-- Type Question 5 Answer Below -->
